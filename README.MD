# LANA TNY

LANA is a small development board based around the [WCH CH32V203](https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH32V203.html) RISC-V microcontroller.

## TNY ?
TNY is our take on the [Adafruit QT Py](https://www.adafruit.com/category/595) and [Seeed studio XIAO](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/) specifiactions but with added SMD pins for optional extra IO capabilities and a built in WS2811 compatible LED output.
