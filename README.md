# LANA TNY
## LANA
LANA is a small development board based around the [WCH CH32V203G6U6](https://www.wch-ic.com/products/CH32V203.html) RISC-V microcontroller. 

## CH32V203
Our initial development was made using the G8U6 variant of this microcontroller featuring more RAM, however by the time we finished the design the chip was no longer available in this small package with the larger RAM size. Therfore we settled for the CH32V203G6U6.
The CH32V203G6 has a single 32-bit RISC-V core, running up to 144MHz, with 1-cycle multiply, and hardware divide. Inside is **10KB** SRAM, **32KB** single-cycle Flash as well as an additional 'external XIP' **224KB** of Flash that can be used for program or data storage but is not as fast as the 32KB. There's also extras you expect: ADC, timers, USB device, UART, I2C, CAN, touch and SPI. 

## Where can I get one?
Currently you can get your hands on the LANA_TNY [in our Lectronz store](https://lectronz.com/products/lana-tny) or [through Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/product/6042).

## Programming

### Writing code
Various options are available.
- [Embeetle](https://embeetle.com/)
	- [Officially supported by Embeetle](https://embeetle.com/#supported-hardware/wch/boards/lana-tny-01)
- [Arduino core](https://github.com/openwch/arduino_core_ch32)
	- SPI and IÂ²C Master support since version 1.0.2
- [Platform.io](https://github.com/Community-PIO-CH32V/platform-ch32v)
	- Requires your WCH-Link firmware to be updated to the latest version
- [CH32V003fun](https://github.com/cnlohr/ch32v003fun)
	- Experimental support for the CH32V203 at the time of writing
- [MounRiver Studio](https://www.mounriver.com/)
	- The official IDE supported by WCH, based on Eclipse.
- [WCH Toolchain for Mac](https://github.com/robinjanssens/WCH-Toolchain)
	- This toolchain has official support for LANA

### Loading code
The CH32V203 has an USB Bootloader which can be activated by holding down the button when plugging in the USB cable. Alternatively you could opt to use a [WCH-Link programmer and debugger](https://www.wch.cn/products/WCH-Link.html) to connect to the exposed SWD pins.

## TNY ?
TNY is our take on the [Adafruit QT Py](https://www.adafruit.com/category/595) and [Seeed studio XIAO](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-XIAO/) specifications but with added SMD pins for optional extra IO capabilities and a built in WS2811 compatible LED output.
